# Astonishment Report

## Strengths

*   **Clear Project Structure:** The project is well-organized with a clear separation between components, pages, styles, and utilities.
*   **Use of Vue 3 and Composition API:** The project uses the latest features of Vue, making it modern and performant.
*   **Use of TypeScript:** The use of TypeScript adds a layer of security and maintainability to the project.
*   **Use of Vite:** Vite is an excellent choice for a fast and efficient development environment.
*   **Complete Features:** The project includes a soundboard, a metronome, and a Pomodoro timer, making it a feature-rich application.
*   **Accessibility:** The project has `aria` attributes and roles to improve accessibility, which is an excellent point.

## Areas for Improvement

*   **Sound Category Management:** The management of sound categories could be improved. Currently, categories are strings, which can lead to typos and inconsistencies.
*   **Sound Management:** The sounds are stored in the `public` folder, which is a good practice. However, the list of sounds is managed manually in the `sounds.json` file. This can become tedious to maintain if the number of sounds increases.
*   **Style Management:** The styles are distributed in several files, which is good, but there is a redundancy in `main.css` which imports `style.css`.
*   **`Bouton.vue` Component:** The `Bouton.vue` component is quite complex and manages both the audio playback logic and the user interface. It could be divided into several smaller components for better readability and maintainability.
*   **`MetronomePage.vue` Component:** The `MetronomePage.vue` component is also very complex and contains a lot of logic. It could be divided into several smaller components and the logic could be extracted into a `useMetronome` composable.
*   **`PomodoroPage.vue` Component:** The `PomodoroPage.vue` component uses a `useTimer` composable, which is an excellent practice. However, sound management could be improved.

## Improvement Suggestions

1.  **Sound Category Management:**
    *   Create a `Category` type for sound categories to avoid typos.
    *   Create a `categories.ts` file to define the available categories.
2.  **Sound Management:**
    *   Create a script to automatically generate the `sounds.json` file from the audio files present in the `public/sounds` folder.
3.  **Style Management:**
    *   Remove the redundant import of `style.css` in `main.css`.
4.  **`Bouton.vue` Component:**
    *   Create a `useAudioPlayer` composable to extract the audio playback logic.
    *   Create a `ProgressBar` component for the progress bar.
    *   Create a `Toast` component for notifications.
5.  **`MetronomePage.vue` Component:**
    *   Create a `useMetronome` composable to extract the metronome logic.
    *   Create smaller components for the controls, the slider, the presets, and the visual display.
6.  **`PomodoroPage.vue` Component:**
    *   Improve sound management by using the `useAudioPlayer` composable suggested above.
